Dear Members and Friends,</br></br>

I  am honoured to have the opportunity to serve as the president of MMW Open House. 
I look forward to bring MMW Open House to its highest level as an association with the support of you and our team members.</br>

MMW Open House stands at a historic moment completing more than 24 month’s journey, share a passion of great commitment towards the welfare of the Mahagun Mywoods resident's (owners/buyers). It has the great journey in raising its voice on day to day issues and develop bonding among residents via social, cultural and msm sports events  of Mahagun MyWoods Society Greater Noida West residents.</br>

MMW Open House is uniquely positioned to help the residents (owners/buyers) in building their confidence in getting their rights against paid maintenance to the builder.</br>

We wish to take significant leap forward and bring it to a class association. We embark on various campaign rights from organizing protest, rally and so on to make aware about the various difficulties which the flat owner/buyers face with the builder. While we have achieved a great deal, there is much more to do as we march toward our lofty goal of a best society. Let us move forward with passion, but also with purpose. And most of all let us be mindful of why we need to be united in achieving our goal.</br>

MMW Open House has been always scholarly and skilfully in pointing out the problems in front of the builder, GNIDA and UP Govt.. I would like to personally encourage you to get involved, to reach out and to connect with us. Remember to update your contact information so we are able to send you information about upcoming events. – See more @ www.mywoodsresidents.com,  I hope you share my pride in our page for all that it has accomplished and for its vision in moving forward.</br>

Our primary goal is to bring forward the issues of member’s owner/buyers of the society, to communicate with authority and builders, to raise issue in media and fund raising for smooth functioning of the association.</br>

I invite all of you in taking a step ahead in our goal. I hope you will consider becoming an active participant in shaping MMW Open House. The future is ours to create.</br>

As always, I would like to thank our wonderful member and hard working core team that help make every event successful. Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication to this association. Together, we will continue to grow MMW Open House for the welfare of the residents  and to protect their rights.</br></br>

Fight for your Rights!</br>
Sincerely!</br>
President -   Vikrant Singh
